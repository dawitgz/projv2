# Catalog Project
Notes: 
1. Login using vagrant ssh
2. Created a custom pylint setup to allow camelCase for function names instead of the default snake_case and also allow for non-capitalized  constant names, it looks cleaner than capitalized.
3. Use localhost:8000 instead of 0.0.0.0:8000 to get Google login to redirect and login properly.
